<h1>Known Issues</h1>
<h3>Windows Known Issues</h3>


<ul>	

  <li>
	<h4>Microsoft Initiator does not boot without link on 
	boot port: </h4>
	<p>After setting up the system for Intel&reg; Ethernet iSCSI  Boot with two 
    ports connected to a target and successfully booting the system, if you 
    later try to boot the system with only the secondary boot port connected to 
    the target, Microsoft Initiator will continuously reboot the system.</p>
    <p>To work around this limitation follow these steps:</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>Using Registry Editor, expand the following registry key:<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters</li>
	  <li>Create a DWORD value called DisableDHCPMediaSense and set the value to 0.</li>
	</ol>

  <li>
	<h4>Moving iSCSI adapter to a different slot:</h4>
	<p>In a Windows* installation, if you move the iSCSI adapter to a PCI slot 
    other than the one that it occupied when the drivers and MS iSCSI Remote Boot
     Initiator were installed, then a System Error may occur during the middle
     of the Windows Splash Screen. This issue goes away if you return the adapter 
     to its original PCI slot. We recommend not moving the adapter used for 
     iSCSI boot installation. This is a known OS issue.</p>
	<p>If you have to move the adapter to another slot, then perform the
    following:</p>
	<ol>
		<li> Boot the operating system and  remove the old adapter</li>
		<li>Install a new adapter into another slot</li>
		<li>Setup the new adapter for iSCSI  Boot</li>
		<li>Perform iSCSI boot to the OS via the original adapter</li>
		<li>Make the new adapter iSCSI-bootable to the OS</li>
		<li>Reboot</li>
		<li>Move the old adapter into another slot</li>
		<li>Repeat steps 2 - 5 for the old adapter you have just moved</li>
	</ol>
  </li>

	<li>
	<h4>Uninstalling Driver can cause blue screen</h4>
	<p>If the driver for the device in use for iSCSI  Boot is 
	uninstalled via Device Manager, Windows will blue screen on reboot and the 
	OS will have to be re-installed. This is a known Windows issue.</p>
  </li>
  
	<li>
	<h4>Adapters flashed with iSCSI image are not removed from the Device 
	Manager during uninstall </h4>
	<p>During uninstallation all other Intel Network Connection Software is 
  	removed, but drivers for iSCSI  Boot adapters that have boot priority. </p>
  </li>
  
	<li>
	<h4>I/OAT Offload may stop with Intel&reg; Ethernet iSCSI  Boot or 
	with Microsoft Initiator installed </h4>
	<p>A workaround for this issue is to change the following registry value 
		to &quot;0&quot;:</p>
	<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\IOATDMA\Start</p>
	<p>Only change the registry value if iSCSI  Boot is enabled and if you 
		want I/OAT offloading. A blue screen will occur if this setting is 
		changed to &quot;0&quot; when iSCSI  Boot is not enabled. It must 
        be set back to &quot;3&quot; if iSCSI  Boot is disabled or a blue 
        screen will occur on reboot.</p>
	</li>
    
  <li>
    <h4>NDIS Driver May Not Load During iSCSI Boot F6 Install With Intel&reg; 
	PRO/1000 PT Server Adapter</h4>
	<p>If you are using two Intel&reg; PRO/1000 PT Server Adapters in two PCI 
  	Express x8 slots of a rack mounted Xeon system, Windows installation 
  	can be done only via a local HDD procedure. </p>
  </li>
    
	<li>
	<h4>Invalid CHAP Settings May Cause Windows&reg; Server 2008 to Blue Screen</h4>
	<p>If an iSCSI Boot port CHAP user name and secret do not match the target 
	CHAP user name and secret, Windows Server 2008 may blue screen or reboot 
	during installation or boot. Ensure that all CHAP settings match those set 
	on the target(s).</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	<h4>F6 Driver Does Not Support Standby Mode. </h4>
	<p>If you are performing an F6 Windows without a Local Disk installation, do 
	not use Standby Mode.</p>
    </li>
    
	<li>
	<h4>Microsoft* Windows Server* 2008 Installation When Performing a WDS Installation</h4>
	<p>If you perform a WDS installation and attempt to manually update drivers during 
	the installation, the drivers load but the iSCSI Target LUN does not display 
	in the installation location list. This is a known WDS limitation with no 
	current fix. You must therefore either perform the installation from a DVD 
	or USB media or inject the drivers on the WDS WinPE image.</p>
	<p>Microsoft has published a knowledge base case explaining the limitation 
	in loading drivers when installing with iSCSI Boot via a WDS server.<br />
	http://support.microsoft.com/kb/960924</p>
	</li>
    
  <li>
	<h4>iSCSI Boot and Teaming in Windows</h4>
	<p>Teaming is not supported with iSCSI Boot. Creating a team 
		using the primary and secondary iSCSI adapters and selecting that team 
		during the Microsoft initiator installation may fail with constant 
		reboots. Do not select a team for iSCSI Boot, even if it is available 
	  for selection during initiator installation. </p>
  	<p>For load balancing and failover support, you can use MSFT MPIO 
	  instead. Check the Microsoft Initiator User Guide on how to setup MPIO.</p>
  </li>

	<li>
	  <h4>Setting LAA (Locally Administered Address) on an iSCSI Boot-Enabled Port 
	    Will Cause System Failure on Next Reboot</h4>
	  <p>Do not set LAA on ports with iSCSI Boot enabled.</p>
    </li>
	

	<li>
	<h4>F6 installation may fail with some EMC targets</h4>
	<p>An F6 installation may fail during the reboot in step 
	  10 of “Installing Windows 2003 without a Local Disk” because of a conflict 
 	 between the Intel F6 driver, the Microsoft iSCSI Initiator and the following 
 	 EMC target model firmware versions:</p>
	
    <blockquote>
    	AX4-5 arrays:&nbsp; 02.23.050.5.705 or higher<br />
		CX300, CX500, CX700, and CX-3 Series arrays:&nbsp; 03.26.020.5.021 or higher.<br />
		CX-4 Series arrays: 04.28.000.5.701 or higher, including all 
        04.29.000.5.xxx revisions.
	</blockquote>
    
	<p>To avoid the failure, ensure that the secondary iSCSI 
	port cannot reach the target during the reboot in step 10.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <h4>With high iSCSI traffic on Microsoft* Windows 2003 Server* R2, link 
    flaps can occur with 82598-based silicon</h4>
	<p>This issue is caused by the limited support for Large Send Offload (LSO) 
  	in this Operating System. Please note that if ISCSI traffic is required for 
  	Windows 2003 Server R2, LSO will be disabled.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <h4>Intel&reg; Ethernet iSCSI Boot version does not match between 
	displayed verions on DMIX and the scrolling 
	text during boot</h4>
    <p>If a device is not set to primary but is enumerated first, the BIOS will 
    	still use that device's version of iSCSI Boot.
	Therefore the user may end up using an earlier version of Intel&reg; Ethernet 
	iSCSI Boot than expected. The solution is that all devices in the system 
    	must have the same version of iSCSI Boot. 
	To do this the user should go to the Boot Options Tab and update the 
	devices' flash to the latest version.</p>
  </li>

</ul>

<ul>
  <li><h4>IPv6 iSCSI login to Dell EqualLogic arrays using jumbo frames</h4>
<p>To establish an iSCSI session using IPv6 and jumbo frames with Dell EqualLogic arrays, TCP/UDP checksum offloads on the Intel iSCSI adapter should be disabled.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>iSCSI/DCB Known Issues</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
	<h4>iSCSI over DCB using Microsoft* Windows Server* 2012</h4>
        <p>iSCSI over DCB (priority tagging) is not possible on the port on which 
  	VMSwitch is created. This is is by design in Microsoft* Windows Server* 2012.</p>
  </li>

	<li><h4>Automatic creation of iSCSI traffic filters for DCB is only supported on 
	networks which make use of IPv4 addressing</h4>
	<p>The iSCSI for Data Center Bridging (DCB) feature uses Quality of Service 
  	(QOS) traffic filters to tag outgoing packets with a priority. The Intel 
  	iSCSI Agent dynamically creates these traffic filters as needed on networks 
  	using IPv4 addressing. </p>
	</li>

  <li><h4>Automatic creation of iSCSI traffic filters for DCB, using Virtual Adapters 
	created by Hyper-V, is only supported on Microsoft* Windows Server* 2008 
	releases R2 and later.</h4>
    <p>The iSCSI for Data Center Bridging (DCB) feature uses Quality of Service 
	(QOS) traffic filters to tag outgoing packets with a priority. The Intel 
	iSCSI Agent dynamically creates these traffic filters as needed for Windows 
  	Server 2008 R2 and later.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
        <h4>IPv6 iSCSI login to Dell EqualLogic arrays using jumbo frames</h4>
        <p>To establish an iSCSI session using IPv6 and jumbo frames with Dell EqualLogic arrays, TCP/UDP checksum                 offloads on the Intel iSCSI adapter should be disabled.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Linux Known Issues</h3>
  <ul>
	<li>
	  <h4>Authentications errors on EqualLogic target may show up in dmesg 
      when running Red Hat* Enterprise Linux 4 </h4>
	<p>These error messages do not indicate a block in login or booting and may 
    safely be ignored.</p>
    </li>

	<li>
  		<h4>Channel Bonding </h4>
		<p>Linux Channel Bonding has basic compatibility issues with iSCSI 
        Boot and should not be used.</p>
    </li>
	
    <li>
	<h4>iBFT System using RHEL 5.2</h4>
	<p>In an iBFT system using RHEL 5.2, Anaconda does not automatically start 
	networking upon installation. The user has to manually bring up networking 
	through a console. Please refer to the RedHat documentation for details on 
	how to manually force up the network.</p>	
    </li>

	<li>
	<h4>CHAP Support with RHEL 5.2</h4>
	<p>RHEL 5.2 does not support CHAP during installation time. If you use CHAP 
	authentication on the target, please disable CHAP during installation and 
	enable it after the installation is complete.</p>
    </li>
	
	<li>
	<h4>RHEL 5.1</h4>
	<p>On RHEL5.1 systems, the wrong network interface is brought up on the 
	first iSCSI Boot after installation. This causes the system to hang and 
	requires a reinstallation at the very least. The workaround for this issue 
	is to edit the init script soon after installation and change the interface 
	you wish to bring up. We strongly encourage our users to use RHEL5.2 to 
	avoid this issue.</p>
	</li>

   	<li>
	<h4>LRO and iSCSI Incompatibility</h4>
	<p>LRO (Large Receive Offload) is incompatible with iSCSI target or initiator 
	traffic. A panic may occur when iSCSI traffic is received through the ixgbe 
	driver with LRO enabled. To workaround this, the driver should be built and 
	installed with:</p>
	<blockquote># make CFLAGS_EXTRA=-DIXGBE_NO_LRO install</blockquote>
	</li>

	<li><h4>RHEL 5.X </h4>
	<p>From a remote LUN, iSCSI boot only works on the same port 
	that was used to install to the remote LUN. You cannot boot from an 
	alternate LAN port after iSCSI is install.</p>
        </li>
  </ul>
