<h1>Overview</h1>
<h2>Intel&reg; Ethernet iSCSI Boot</h2>
<p>Intel&reg; Ethernet iSCSI  Boot is designed for  PCI-Express Server Adapters. Intel 
Ethernet iSCSI  Boot provides the capability to boot from a remote iSCSI disk volume located on an iSCSI-based Storage Area Network (SAN). This guide covers hardware and software installation, setup procedures, and troubleshooting tips for installing and booting the system using these adapters.</p><hr>
<h2>iSCSI Over DCB (Data Center Bridging)</h2>
<p>Intel® Ethernet adapters support iSCSI software initiators that are native to 
the underlying operating system. In the case of Windows, the Microsoft iSCSI 
Software Initiator, enables connection of a Windows host to an external iSCSI 
storage array using an Intel Ethernet adapter. </p>
<p>In the case of Open Source distributions, virtually all distributions include 
support for an Open iSCSI Software Initiator and Intel® Ethernet adapters will 
support them. Please consult your distribution documentation for additional 
configuration details on their particular Open iSCSI initiator.</p>
<p>Intel® 82599 and X540-based 10 gigabit adapters support iSCSI within a Data Center 
Bridging cloud. Used in conjunction with switches and targets that support the 
iSCSI/DCB application TLV, this solution can provide guaranteed minimum 
bandwidth for iSCSI traffic between the host and target. This solution enables 
storage administrators to segment iSCSI traffic from LAN traffic, similar to how 
they can currently segment FCoE from LAN traffic. Previously, iSCSI traffic 
within a DCB supported environment was treated as LAN traffic by switch 
vendors.&nbsp; Please consult your switch and target vendors to ensure that they 
support the iSCSI/DCB application TLV. </p>
