<p><strong><u>OWNERSHIP OF SOFTWARE AND COPYRIGHTS.</u></strong> The Software is 
    licensed, not sold. Title to all copies of the Software remains with Intel. The 
    Software is copyrighted and protected by the laws of the United States and other 
    countries and international treaty provisions. You may not remove any copyright 
    notices from the Software. You agree to prevent any unauthorized copying of the 
    Software. Intel may make changes to the Software, or to items referenced 
    therein, at any time without notice, but is not obligated to support or update 
    the Software.</p>

<p><strong><u>ADDITIONAL TERMS FOR  PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE.</u></strong>&nbsp; If the 
    Software you are installing or using under this Agreement is pre-commercial 
    release or is labeled or otherwise represented as “alpha-“ or “beta-“ versions 
    of the Software (&quot;pre-release Software&quot;), then the following terms apply. To the 
    extent that any provision in this Section conflicts with any other term(s) or 
    condition(s) in this Agreement with respect to pre-release Software, this 
    Section shall supersede the other term(s) or condition(s), but only to the 
    extent necessary to resolve the conflict. You understand and acknowledge that 
    the Software is pre-release Software, does not represent the final Software from 
    Intel, and may contain errors and other problems that could cause data loss, 
    system failures, or other errors. The pre-release Software is provided to you 
    &quot;as-is&quot; and Intel disclaims any warranty or liability to you for any damages 
    that arise out of the use of the pre-release Software. You acknowledge that 
    Intel has not promised that pre-release Software will be released in the future, 
    that Intel has no express or implied obligation to you to release the 
    pre-release Software and that Intel may not introduce Software that is 
    compatible with the pre-release Software. You acknowledge that the entirety of 
    any research or development you perform that is related to the pre-release 
    Software or to any product making use of or associated with the pre-release 
    Software is done at your own risk. If Intel has provided you with pre-release 
    Software pursuant to a separate written agreement, your use of the pre-release 
    Software is also governed by such agreement.</p>

<p><strong><u>LIMITED  MEDIA WARRANTY.</u></strong>&nbsp; If the Software has been 
    delivered by Intel on physical media, Intel warrants the media to be free from 
    material physical defects for a period of ninety days after delivery by Intel. 
    If such a defect is found, return the media to Intel for replacement or 
    alternate delivery of the Software as Intel may select.</p>

<p><strong><u>EXCLUSION  OF OTHER WARRANTIES.</u>&nbsp; EXCEPT AS PROVIDED ABOVE, 
    THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF ANY 
    KIND INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR FITNESS FOR A 
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</strong> Intel does not warrant or assume responsibility for 
    the accuracy or completeness of any information, text, graphics, links, or other 
    items contained within the Software.</p>

<p><strong><u>LIMITATION  OF LIABILITY.</u>&nbsp; IN NO EVENT SHALL INTEL OR ITS 
    SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, 
    LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR LOST INFORMATION) ARISING OUT OF THE USE 
    OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF INTEL HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS PROHIBIT EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION 
    OF LIABILITY FOR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO 
    THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER LEGAL RIGHTS 
    THAT VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.</strong> In the event that you use 
    the Software in conjunction with a virtual (“emulated”) device designed to 
    appear as an Intel component product, you acknowledge that Intel is neither the 
    author nor the creator of the virtual (“emulated”) device. You understand and 
    acknowledge that Intel makes no representations about the correct operation of 
    the Software when used with a virtual (“emulated”) device, that Intel did not 
    design the Software to operate in conjunction with the virtual (“emulated”) 
    device, and that the Software may not be capable of correct operation in 
    conjunction with the virtual (“emulated”) device. You agree to assume the risk 
    that the Software may not operate properly in conjunction with the virtual 
    (“emulated”) device. You agree to indemnify and hold Intel and its officers, 
    subsidiaries and affiliates harmless against all claims, costs, damages, and 
    expenses, and reasonable attorney fees arising out of, directly or indirectly, 
    any claim of product liability, personal injury or death associated with the use 
    of the Software in conjunction with the virtual (“emulated”) device, even if 
    such claim alleges that Intel was negligent regarding the design or manufacture 
    of the Software.</p>

<p><strong><u>UNAUTHORIZED USE.</u></strong> <strong>THE SOFTWARE IS NOT DESIGNED, 
    INTENDED, OR AUTHORIZED FOR USE IN ANY TYPE OF SYSTEM OR APPLICATION IN WHICH 
    THE FAILURE OF THE SOFTWARE COULD CREATE A SITUATION WHERE PERSONAL INJURY OR 
    DEATH MAY OCCUR (E.G MEDICAL SYSTEMS, LIFE SUSTAINING OR LIFE SAVING SYSTEMS).</strong> 
    If you use the Software for any such unintended or unauthorized use, you shall 
    indemnify and hold Intel and its officers, subsidiaries and affiliates harmless 
    against all claims, costs, damages, and expenses, and reasonable attorney fees 
    arising out of, directly or indirectly, any claim of product liability, personal 
    injury or death associated with such unintended or unauthorized use, even if 
    such claim alleges that Intel was negligent regarding the design or manufacture 
    of the part.</p>

<p><strong><u>TERMINATION  OF THIS AGREEMENT.</u></strong> 
Intel may terminate this Agreement at any time if you violate its terms. 
Upon termination, you will immediately destroy the Software or return all copies of the Software to Intel. </p>

<p><strong><u>APPLICABLE  LAWS.</u></strong> 
    Claims arising under this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State 
    of California, without regard to principles of conflict of laws. You agree that 
    the terms of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the Sale of Goods do 
    not apply to this Agreement. You may not export the Software in violation of 
    applicable export laws and regulations. Intel is not obligated under any other 
    agreements unless they are in writing and signed by an authorized representative 
    of Intel.</p>
