a device. All utilities and software are able to read older versions of 
the Master FLB. However, you must update any utilities software you use 
to a more recent version to use the new Master FLB. Please upgrade to 
the following versions (or a more recent version):

- BootUtil, v. 1.3.5.xxx
- Intel(R) Proset for Windows* Device Manager, v. 17.1.xxx
- SMASH, v2-2.0.0.58
