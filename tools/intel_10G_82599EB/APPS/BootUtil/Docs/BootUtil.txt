INTRODUCTION
============
The Intel(R) Ethernet Flash Firmware Utility (BootUtil) is a utility that
can be used to program the PCI option ROM on the flash memory of supported 
Intel PCI and PCI-Express-based network adapters, and to update configurations.
BootUtil replaces existing utilities and provides the functionality of the 
older IBAUTIL, ISCSIUTL, LANUTIL, and FLAUTIL. BootUtil supports all the 
adapters supported by the previous utilities.

NOTE: Updating the adapter's flash memory using BootUtil will erase any existing
firmware image from the flash memory.

Intel provides the following flash firmware in FLB file format for programming to
the flash memory:

- Intel(R) Boot Agent as PXE Option ROM for legacy BIOS
  http://www.intel.com/support/network/adapter/pro100/bootagent/

- Intel(R) iSCSI Remote Boot as iSCSI Option ROM for legacy BIOS
  http://www.intel.com/support/network/iscsi/remoteboot/

- Network Connectivity, UEFI network driver
  http://www.intel.com/support/network/sb/cs-006120.htm

OEMs may provide custom flash firmware images for OEM network adapters. Please
refer to the instructions given by OEMs.

BootUtil allows the user to flash supported firmware to the adapter from
the included master FLB file. This option ROM includes PXE, iSCSI, FCoE,
and UEFI drivers, and the image is programmed to the flash memory at once. 
BootUtil will also build the required combo images for supported adapter
and program those images to the flash, as well. Since both discrete and combo
images are supported, the -BOOTENABLE command ONLY works on combo images.

PXE+EFI and iSCSI+EFI image combinations are supported for all OEM generic 
adapters, however support is limited to devices which support both technologies
as discrete images. However, flash size is a limiting factor, as the image size
can change without notice.

The Master FLB file (BOOTIMG.FLB) is the new container for all the Intel(R)
boot Option ROMs. This file replaces the existing FLB files for iSCSI, PXE, 
FCoE and EFI. 

NOTE: BootUtil supports older flb files to maintain backwards compatibility
with the previous utilities.

BootUtil without command-line options will display a list of all supported 
Intel network ports in the system. BootUtil will also allow the user to enable
or disable the flash memory on specific ports by using -FLASHENABLE or 
-FLASHDISABLE options in order to control access to the firmware from the 
system.

BootUtil allows the user to individually set iSCSI, FCoE, UEFI and PXE boot
configurations by -NIC=xx -[OPTION]=[VALUE] options. The -I option is iSCSI 
specific and will not work for PXE configurations.

NOTES: BootUtil displays up to 128 adapter ports.
No configuration settings are supported for the UEFI driver. 
Functionality from the previous utility, IBAutil, is preserved in BootUtil.

BootUtil is located on the software installation CD in the \APPS\BootUtil
directory. Check the Intel Customer Support (http://support.intel.com) website
for the latest information and component updates.


RUNNING BootUtil
================
The syntax for issuing BootUtil command-line options is:

BOOTUTIL -[OPTION] or -[OPTION]=[VALUE]


COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
====================
BootUtil accepts one executable option and its associated non-executable
options in an execution. If conflicting executable options (such as 
-FLASHENABLE and -UPDATE used together) are supplied, BOOTUTIL exits with an 
error.

The options, where applicable, are listed in logical groups.

NOTE: If you run BootUtil without any command-line options, the utility
displays a list of all supported Intel network ports found in the system.

GENERAL OPTIONS:
    -HELP or -?
      Displays a list of command-line options.
    -EXITCODES
      Displays exit codes returned to the OS environment by BootUtil.
    -IMAGEVERSION or -IV
      Displays firmware types and version numbers from a resource image.
      If used with the -FILE option, the resource image is in the FLB file.
      If used with the -NIC option, the resource image is in the adapter flash.
      If used with the -ALL option, each resource image is continuously
      displayed for all adapters.
    -E
      Enumerates all supported network ports in the system.
    -O=[FILENAME]
      Must be used with -E or -NIC.
      If used with the -E option, saves a list of all NICs and their MAC 
      addresses to the specified file.
      If used with the -NIC option, saves all iSCSI Remote Boot configuration 
      options for the specified NIC to the specified file.
    -I=[FILENAME]
      Reads iSCSI boot configuration options from [FILENAME] script file and
      program settings on the selected port.
    -FILE=[FILENAME]
      Specifies the file name for -SAVEIMAGE, -RESTOREIMAGE, -SAVECONFIG, 
      -RESTORECONFIG, -UP or -UPDATE options.
    -P
      With this command, BootUtil pauses screen after displaying every 25th 
      line. 
      In pause mode, last line of the screen will contain information that:
      - screen has been paused, and
      - user can press Enter to continue
    -NODPL
      With command, BootUtil does not display the PCI device location.


POWER MANAGEMENT OPTIONS:
    -WOLENABLE or -WOLE
      Enables Wake On Lan (WOL) functionality on the selected port.
    -WOLDISABLE or -WOLD
      Disables Wake On Lan (WOL) functionality on the selected port.

ADAPTER SELECTION OPTIONS:
    -ALL
      Selects all supported network ports found in the system.
    -NIC=XX
      Selects a specific network port in the system. If used without any
      executable option, it prints the iSCSI boot configuration of the
      selected port, or saves it in the file when the -O option is used.
    -TARGET=XX
     This is an FCoE-specific selection option. Legal values are 1,2,3,and 4.
     This option is required for configuration commands -WWPN, -FCOELUN,
     FCOEVLAN, and -BOOTORDER.
    -BLINK
      Blinks the LED on the selected port for ten seconds.

ADAPTER FLASH ENABLE/DISABLE OPTIONS:

      The combo option ROM could have all capabilities. The monolithic
      option ROM has either PXE, iSCSI, or FCoE capability but not all. This
      command will NOT WORK on monolithic Option ROMs. 
      
      NOTES:
      This manual command is not applicable to the UEFI network driver.
      The UEFI network driver is enabled by default and loaded automatically
      unless network ports are already used by other flash firmware.

      BOOTENABLE=DISABLED
      Disables iSCSI, PXE and FCoE functionalities for legacy BIOS.

FLASH PROGRAMMING OPTIONS:
    -UP or -UPDATE=[ROMType] [-FILE=Filename]
      Updates the flash memory of the adapter specified by the -NIC option with
      the given FLB flash firmware image file. If -QUIET is not specified, 
      the user is prompted to confirm overwriting the existing firmware image 
      before upgrading. If a Filename is not provided, the utility looks for the
      default bootimg.FLB file which contains all image types.
      
      The following examples use pxe, but could also be efi, efi64, FCoE or 
      iSCSI.
      eg: Bootutil -Nic=x -up=pxe
      or Bootutil -Nic=x -up=pxe -file=pxeimg.flb

      If your adapter supports a combo option rom, the following command option 
      automatically detects the supported combo image and programs the adapter 
      with that image.
      -up=combo
       up=pxe+efi and up=iscsi+efi are valid.
    -SAVEIMAGE or SI
      Saves the existing firmware image in the flash memory of the adapter
      specified by the -NIC option to a disk file. The destination file is
      specified by the -FILE option.
    -RESTOREIMAGE or RI
      Restores a previously-saved firmware image to the same network adapter
      using the -NIC option. The source file is specified by the -FILE option.
    -QUIET
      Runs BootUtil without confirmation prompts. This option is used with
      -IMAGEVERSION, -UP, -UPDATE, -RESTOREIMAGE, or -HELP option.

PXE BOOT CONFIGURATION OPTIONS: (Can be used with -NIC or -ALL)        
    -DEFAULTCONFIG or -DEFCFG

EXAMPLES
========
The following examples show how to enter some typical BootUtil command lines:

Example 1:
To enable the flash firmware on the first network adapter for the system to be
capable of executing the flash firmware.
    BootUtil -NIC=1 -FLASHENABLE

Example 2:
To disable the flash firmware on all the network adapters.
    BootUtil -ALL -FD

Example 3:
To display BootUtil FLB flash firmware types and versions.
    BootUtil -IMAGEVERSION

Example 4:
To update all ports of a supported NIC with PXE. 
    1. BootUtil -UP=PXE -ALL (Assumes input file is bootimg.flb)
    2. Bootutil -UP=PXE -ALL -FILE=BOOTIMG.FLB (explicit user specified file)

Example 5:
To update a combo image on supported adapter (eg, pxe+iscsi)
    1. Bootutil -UP=Combo -NIC=2 -FILE=BOOTIMG.FLB

The above command will succeed if the PXE+ISCSI combination is supported on
NIC #2. If not an error is displayed to the user.

NOTE: THE -UP and -UPDATE commands are equivalent and interchangeable.

Example 6:
To enable PXE firmware on the third network port in the system.
    BootUtil -BOOTENABLE=PXE -NIC=3

NOTE: This command will work only if PXE is part of a combo Option ROM and
not a discrete Option ROM.

Example 7:
To disable the firmware on the second network port in the system.
    BootUtil -NIC=2 -BOOTENABLE=DISABLED

Example 8:
To get help descriptions.
    BootUtil -?

Example 9:
To enable DHCP for the iSCSI initiator on all the network ports in the system.
    BootUtil -INITIATORDHCP=ENABLE -ALL

Example 10:
To load the iSCSI boot configurations from a text script file to the first
network port.
    BootUtil -I=CONFIG.TXT -NIC=1
