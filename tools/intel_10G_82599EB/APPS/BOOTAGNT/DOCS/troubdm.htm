<h2><a name="issues"></a>Common Issues</h2>
<P>
The following list of problems and associated solutions covers a representative 
set of problems that you might encounter while using the Intel Boot Agent. </P>

<h4><i>After booting, my computer experiences problems</i></h4>
<P>
After the Intel&reg; Boot Agent product has finished its sole task (remote booting), it no longer 
has any effect on the client computer operation.
Thus, any issues that arise after the boot process is complete are most likely
not related to the Intel Boot Agent product.</P>
<P>
If you are having problems with the local (client) or network operating system, contact 
the operating system manufacturer for assistance. If you are having problems with some 
application program, contact the application manufacturer for assistance. If you are 
having problems with any of your computer's hardware or with the
<a href="glossary.htm#BIOS">BIOS</a>, contact your computer system manufacturer for
assistance.</P>

<h4><i>Cannot change boot order</i></h4>
<P>
If you are accustomed to redefining your computer's boot order using the 
motherboard BIOS setup program, the default settings of the Intel Boot Agent setup 
program can override that setup. To change the boot sequence, you must first 
override the Intel Boot Agent setup program defaults. A configuration setup menu 
appears allowing you to set configuration values for the Intel Boot Agent. To change your computer's boot order setting, see
<a href="configdm.htm#pxe">Configuring the Boot Agent in a Pre-boot PXE Environment</a>.
</P>

<h4><i>My computer does not complete POST</i></h4>
<P>
If your computer fails to boot with an adapter installed, but <i>does</i> boot
when you remove the adapter, try moving the adapter to another computer and using
<a href="boot_util.htm">BootUtil</a> to disable the Flash ROM.</P>
<P>If this does not work, the problem may be occurring before the Intel Boot 
Agent
software even begins operating. In this case, there may be a BIOS problem with
your computer. Contact your computer manufacturer's customer support group for
help in correcting your problem.</P>

<h4><i>There are configuration/operation problems with the boot process</i></h4>
<P>
  If your PXE client receives a DHCP address, but then fails to boot, you know the
  PXE client is working correctly. Check your network or PXE server configuration
  to troubleshoot the problem. Contact
  <a target="_blank" class="NoIndex" href="http://www.intel.com/support/">Intel Customer Support</a> 
  if you need further assistance.
</P>

<h4><i>POST hang may occur if two or more ports on Quad Port Server Adapters are 
	configured for PXE </i></h4>

<p>
	If you have an Intel&reg; Gigabit VT Quad Port 
	Server Adapter, </span></font>Intel&reg; PRO/1000 PT Quad Port LP Server 
	Adapter, or an Intel&reg; PRO/1000 PF Quad Port Server Adapter with two or more 
	ports configured for PXE, you may experience POST hangs on some server 
	systems. If this occurs the suggested workaround is move the adapter to 
	another system and disable PXE on all but one port of the Adapter. You may 
	also be able to prevent this problem by disabling any on-board SCSI or SAS 
	controllers in your system BIOS.

<h2><a name="diag_pxe"></a>Diagnostics Information for Pre-boot PXE Environments</h2>
<p>Anytime the configuration setup menu is displayed (see
<a href="configdm.htm#pxe">Configuring
the Boot Agent in a Pre-boot PXE Environment</a>), diagnostics information is 
also displayed on the lower portion of the screen. The information
displayed appears similar to that shown in the lower half of the screen image
below. This information can be helpful during interaction with
<a target="_blank" class="NoIndex" href="http://www.intel.com/support/">Intel Customer Support</a> 
personnel or your IT team members. </p>
