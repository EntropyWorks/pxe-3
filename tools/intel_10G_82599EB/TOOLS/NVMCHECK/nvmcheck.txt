OVERVIEW
========

NVMCHECK verifies that the NVM image is an authentic image. 


RUNNING THE UTILITY
===================

Using the "/?" option will display a list of supported command line options.

OPTIONS:
--------

NVMCHECK can be run with any of the following command line options:

    /HELP or /?
        Displays command line help.
    /VERSION
        Displays the tool version and Quartzville SDK information.
    /DEVICES
	Displays the device list.
    /NIC=XX
        Selects a specific device (1-32).
    /VERIFY
    	Verifies the NVM signature of the selected device.
  Technical support options:
    /HEADER
        Displays the NVM header of the selected device.
    /KEY
        Displays the NVM key of the selected device.


BASIC USAGE GUIDELINES
----------------------
To display a list of installed adapters call NVMCHECK using the /DEVICES option.

NVMCHECK will display a list of network adapters installed in the
system similar to the following:

    NIC Bus Dev Fun Vendor-Device     MAC           ENA
    === === === === ============= ================= ===
     1   1   00  00   8086-1533   00-21-6A-1b-50-82 YES
     2   8   00  00   8086-1521   00-24-7E-15-25-21 N/A
     3   4   00  00   8086-1535   00-25-90-6C-32-20 NO


To perform an operation on an installed network adapter you must specify
the "/NIC=" parameter.  For example, to verify the NVM on NIC 1 from the 
list above call EEUPDATE like this:

NVMCHECK /NIC=1 /VERIFY

The tool will return:
  NVM Integrity verification [PASSED/FAILED]

Installation
=============

INSTALLING THE TOOLS ON MICROSOFT WINDOWS*
==========================================

The tools driver can be installed on all versions of Microsoft Windows* since 
Windows 7. To install the tools' drivers on Windows, run install.bat from the 
appropriate directory on the CD.   

Although the tools are not installed with install.bat, the driver that the tools 
require is copied into the local machine Windows driver directory. To run the 
tools, launch a Command Prompt window from the Windows Start Menu. Go to the 
media and directory where the tools are located and run the tools. The readme 
files for each tool are found in the same directory as the tools. These tools 
can be manually installed on the local hard drive in any directory.

The tool uses its own driver file (not the same as the system network driver).
If the driver sys file already exists in the drivers directory, install.bat may
fail to copy. Using the /y switch with install.bat will override and copy the 
driver file regardless. However, this can be dangerous if an older version of 
the driver is being used by another application such as Intel(R) PROset for Windows
Device Manager. If a driver is already present in the drivers directory, try 
running the tool from the command prompt. If it runs, then the driver is fine. 
The tool will not run if the driver version present does not match the driver 
version expected.

Note that for Windows 7 (and later), the user must have access to the 
%systemroot%\system32\drivers directory. Only the administrator account has these
privileges. The user must be logged in as administrator or the tools must be 
"run as" administrator.

Note that on Windows, any device that is disabled in device manager will not be
accessible by tools due to no memory resources. You would get an error code 0xC86A800E.
To solve this problem, you can do one of the following:
1) Re-enable the device in device manager. Never disable this device when using tools.
2) Install an NDIS device driver for the device and make sure that it does not have
   a yellow or red bang by it in device manager.
3) Delete the device from device manager and restart the system. The install new 
   hardware wizard should appear on next reboot. Do not cancel this. Just move the
   window aside and run the tool(s). Generally, you can click "cancel" on the wizard
   but there are some cases where Windows will disable the memory resources causing
   you to get back into the same state.


INSTALLING THE TOOLS ON EFI
==============================

The tools support Intel(R) EFI v1.10. There is no installation required for EFI tools.  
The tools can simply be copied to the drive that they will run from. 

Note that while EFI supports USB drives, there may be issues running tools from the USB
drive. Whether or not there are issues are BIOS specific. If issues are experienced,
the tool should be run from hard disk instead.


INSTALLING THE TOOLS ON DOS
===========================

The tools support various DOS versions from Windows XP DOS (reached by creating
a DOS boot disk in the explorer GUI) to FreeDOS.  There is no installation required for 
DOS tools. The tools can simply be copied from the DOS directory on the CD to the drive
that they will run from.  It is expected that the tools have a clean boot environment. 
The tools will not run with memory managers and/or DOS networking drivers loaded. 
The tools expect that they have full, unlimited control of the hardware. The tools 
*WILL NOT* run properly if EMM386 is present.  The tools run in protected mode, 32-bit
DOS. Therefore, they will not be compatible with any TSR programs.


INSTALLING THE TOOLS ON LINUX*
==============================

In order to run tools on Linux*, a driver stub must be built and installed on 
the system. This driver is not related to the network device driver that is 
used to run the network during live traffic. It is a separate driver used 
explicitly for tools. Due to the nature of Linux with the number of kernels 
that can exist, we provide source for the driver module and an install script 
to build/install it.

The tools support Linux distributions based on kernels 2.6.x. Validation is done 
randomly on popular distributions such as Red Hat* or Suse*. Configured 
kernel source that matches the currently installed kernel is required. A working 
GCC is also required. There are some versions of GCC that had a bug which did not 
support unnamed structures. These versions of GCC are not supported. If you have 
compilation errors, try updating your version of GCC.  If you have linker errors 
when installing the driver, you should update your kernel - download the latest 
stable off www.kernel.org and build/install it.

Note that some distributions such as recent Fedora core versions do not ship with Kernel 
source. You must download, install, and configure the source in order to get the tools' 
driver built on this OS. Installing the kernel source RPM does not solve the problem.

This is the installation procedure for the RPM package:

    1. Log in as root.

    2. Copy the RPM package (iqvlinux-<version>.noarch.rpm) to the home directory.

    3. CD to the home directory and run command: rpm -i iqvlinux-<version>.noarch.rpm. 

    4. Copy the tools that you want to use from the appropriate directory of the CD.
