IOUtil
======

IOUtil will allow the adapter to be configured to change whether or not it will request IO map mode access to the device.  

This utility is designed for system integrators. Only use it if your system has a high port density or you know you don’t need IO mapped access to the card.  Disabling IO access will prevent some pre-boot and DOS driver technologies from working.
