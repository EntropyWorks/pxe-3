This directory contains example Python scripts demonstrating sFlow-RT's
REST API:

* threshold.py      - set a threshold and display resulting events
* tail_log.py       - tail the event log
* ddos.py           - detect large flows
* memcache_keys.py  - detect hot/missed Memcache keys

Note: The scripts make use of the Python requests library:
      http://python-requests.org/

The demo.pcap file contains captured sFlow datagrams. To run sFlow-RT using
the captured file, modify the start script as follows:

start.sh
  JVM_OPTS="-Dsflow.file=extras/demo.pcap"

start.bat
  java -Dsflow.file=extras\demo.pcap -jar lib\sflowrt.jar
