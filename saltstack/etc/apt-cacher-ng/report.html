         Please visit any invalid download URL to see <a href=/>configuration
            instructions</a> for users. For system administrators, read the manual
         which may be available on the <a href=file:///usr/share/doc/apt-cacher-ng/html/index.html>local filesystem</a> or
         be <a href=http://$SERVERIP/doc/apt-cacher-ng/html/index.html>browsable here</a>.
         <h2>Index update and processing options</h2>
         Temporary options for the general behavour and index update
         configuration can set in this user interface. They are only relevant
         to expiration and import features triggered below.
         <br />
               <input type="checkbox" name="abortOnErrors" value="aOe" @A> Stop cleanup on errors during index update step
               <br>
               <input type="checkbox" name="beVerbose" value="bV"> More verbosity
               <br>
               <input type="checkbox" name="forceRedownload" value="fRd"> Force the download of index files (even having fresh ones)
               <br>

         <h2>Expiration</h2>
         <p>
         Expiration mechanism is needed to delete files from the local cache when
         they are removed on the servers, e.g. when the software versions of the
         package is updated and the package files are replaced. This is rarely
         needed when Stable system distribution is used by the clients, but use of
         unstable branches with high fluctuation requires to clean up the local
         cache from time to time. ACNG includes helper code to identify
         unreferenced files automatically (executed with the button below).
         <br>
         <b>Warning:</b> this operation may redownload all index files. The current
         implementation does not support delta-based reconstruction of index files
         ("pdiff" mechanism).
         </p>

            <h3>Scan and semi-automatic expiration</h3>
            The default method does update the index files, check the
            files present in the cache and optionally delete them. The
            checks consist of file name comparison and optionally file
            contents verification or directory location comparison.
            Files that are not listed in any index file or have
            incorrect contents are marked for removal in one of the
            later sessions, or can be removed by direct user action
            triggered with the controls below.

            <h2>Import</h2>
            <p>
            Importing package files from foreign sources works in following case:
            <p>
            Files can be assigned to <b>known</b> download locations. The
            locations become known when they are found in index files. However,
            this index files must exist in the package cache, therefore at least
            one client needs to download them, i.e. running "<b>apt-get update</b>" on a client system
            which is configured for use with ACNG. See ACNG manual for more details.

            <!--
            </li>
         </ul>
         -->
         When all conditions are met <!--for one of the described ways,--> put your files into
         the "_import" directory, e.g. <i>/var/cache/apt-cacher-ng/_import/</i>.
         Subdirectories and symlinks are ok. Then run import.       </p>
